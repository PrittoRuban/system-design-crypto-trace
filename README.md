# **Software Solution to Identify the End Receiver of a Cryptocurrency Transaction**

## **Problem Statement**

**Title:** Software solution to identify the end receiver of a cryptocurrency transaction

**Description:**

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, USDT, and Monero are increasingly being used in drug trafficking due to their relative anonymity and quick transaction speeds. Drug traffickers, often operating on darknet markets and other internet-enabled platforms, use cryptocurrencies for transactions and to store the proceeds of their illegal activities. These funds are frequently laundered through tumblers, mixers, and other services to obscure their origins.

**Challenge:** Law enforcement agencies frequently acquire wallet addresses and transaction hashes related to these illicit activities. Tracking these transactions is critical to uncovering the identities of those involved in drug trafficking networks.

**Objective:** Develop a software solution that traces cryptocurrency transactions linked to a specific wallet ID or transaction hash, ultimately identifying the end recipient in drug-related transactions.
